# WordGuessr
A take on the popular Wordle game

Hello there! I'm sure you've heard of Wordle (if not, check it out, it's a great online word game), turns out this is something I used to play with my dad and sister as a kid, albeit a slightly different slightly more difficult version where it wasn't revealed which letters were in the right position or correct & and in the wrong position, only how many cases of each there are.

Well, with the nostalgia that the game brought, and the fear that it might not be free forever now it's been snatched up by the New York Times, I decided to have a go at making my own version! By no means perfect, but it works and it's something I didn't think I could do (admittedly I nearly gave up a couple times with issues that magically fixed themselves, we do love java). Also lacking testing because that wasn't the initial goal of this project, so that may come at a later date...

**To run this thing - simply copy the code into your IDE, make sure you have Java 11 installed, and click run!**

TO PLAY:

- click run
- start typing any 5 letter word, backspace also works, press enter once you are happy with your 5 letter word to check it.
- green fields show a correct letter in the correct position
- yellow fields show a correct letter in the wrong position
- keep guessing until you get the right word (or don't)
- the game will automatically end when you guess correctly or are out of guesses.
- to play again, close the window and rerun.


n.b. at the moment you can guess any word, doesn't have to be a real word (that's something I'll work on). Also, I tried to allow for 6 guesses, but this somehow broke the code, so that's also something I'll work on trying to fix.
